# Form Funnel

> A simple, specialized electron app for quickly filling out common Form-fillable PDFs.

This form filler saves time when you've got a bunch of form-fillable PDFs that you frequently fill from data elsewhere in your system.

We remember form selections based on certain column data to make your next use easier.

#### **Example**
>For each house built in a township, someone at a construction company typically fills out a bunch of forms for various utilities, HOAs, certifications, internal documents, etc.
>
>With this app you just load that data via Google Sheets, xls, or csv then add your PDFs and press `Fill 'em` to complete the forms.

## **Functionality**

- Link a Google Sheets document
- Select form-fillable PDFs (FDFs)
- Save form selection based on a specific column
- Fill those PDFs with selected rows from the Google Sheet
- Remember all selections so that future use is much faster

I collect crash and usage information to find bugs and improve the UX.
